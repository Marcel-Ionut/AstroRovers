This is the robot for ExoRo contest.
It's a rover that can be used for missions on another planet like the "Curiosity Rover". It is set up to measure some parameters like temperature, humidity and gases concentration. It has also a camera that it's used to control the rover and a robotic arm that can take soil samples to analize it at the UV spectrum.
